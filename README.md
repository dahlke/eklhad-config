# Eklhad Config

A tool to gather your configurations and store them here so you can migrate personal machines more easily. Mine are in the `collected/` dir here as an example and also for my own easy access.


### Usage
To collect all of the files you need, use the `figo.py` script, which will collect all files listed in `config/files.json`:

```
$ ./figo.py --collect
```
